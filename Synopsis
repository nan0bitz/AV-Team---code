In 2008, I was working for one of Canada's leading manufacturer of appliances; at that time, I was working on a number of ideas to improve
new and existing employee interest. One concept was to model a board game after the characteristics of the company itself; at the time it was called "Battle For Loyalty"; 
where the services and parts side of the business. Note, at this time, the name 'gamification'was not known to me. The objective of the business had been drafted out into segments. 
From there, I began to layout the board game. Later in 2010; I stopped working on that project
due to the fact that a employee website was being created for company and they wanted immediate employee interest globally. During this time, I saw the opportunity
to improve the website yet from a different angle. So I created a story about the founder of the company and how his vision of the company
was always with him. Using day-dream like senarios; his personal interactions with people and a template of an image he simple could not shake
I built a story board and suggested that the company use a game engine (UE2 or Neo Axis) to bring the game into existence and have the 
interest be slightly addictive. 
  Well, I had spoke with a manager in the US about my idea; she in turn referred me to a direct in the US; once I spoke to
  that contact in the US; he was so engaged in my idea; he said ... "Brian, can we set up a meeting to discuss this further; we have a 
  US team thats working revising our website however, what I am hearing from you sounds very exciting!" That director and I spoke on several
  conference calls for almost a year. While my idea never took off due to company restructuring, there are many lessons learned from this experience.
